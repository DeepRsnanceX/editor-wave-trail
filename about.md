# Cherry Badges

This mod **adds some cherry team badges** using Badges API.

**LolsShow** and **BlastiX** made the badge template. **maximaldash** made several variants of those badges for all member roles and **dogotrigger** imported them into the game.

<cy>**Don't see the badge in your profile?**</c> Tell me in <cb>Discord</c> and I will fix this issue in a next update.
